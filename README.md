# myroutine
This is a project to schedule routine

1. This project was first built with ES5 SYNTAX. 
    It uses the function method to name it prototype. i.e for any prototype, it calls a function after it e.g 
    UI.prototype.showAlert = function() {}

2. It was later converted to the ES6 which is referred to the convinience syntax or synthetic sugar. because it allow us to write less code.
